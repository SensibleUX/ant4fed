NOTE: This is not a fully-working version yet. These directions are not currently accurate.



The directory that this file sits in needs to be in the root of your workspace in order to work properly.
If you have different needs, you'll have to change all of the filepaths.

Prerequisites:
	* you must have ANT installed. If you're not sure if you have this, you probably don't, but
		you can check by opening up a terminal and typing ('>' is a terminal denotation, don't
		actually type it):
			> ant -version
		
		If terminal tells you the version of ANT, you're all set. If not, visit the apache ANT website.
		
Targets:
	* jslint
		Syntax:
			> ant jslint -Djsdir=<path to the directory you want linted, starting from the parent directory>
		
		Example:
			> ant jslint -Djsdir=project/javascript
				(NOTE: Make sure you specify the full path starting with this parent directory.)
		
		Results:
			The results are stored in a nice pretty html file that lives in ./reports/jslint.html
	
	*csslint
		Syntax:
			> ant csslint -Dcssdir=<path to the directory you want linted, starting with the project name>
			
		Example:
			> ant csslint -Dcssdir=project/css			(NOTE: Read the previous NOTE)
		
		Results:
			The results are stored in a nice pretty html file that lives in ./reports/csslint.html
	
	*jsbeautify
		Syntax:
			> ant beautify -Dbfile=<path and FILENAME of file you want to beautify, starting with the project name>
				NOTE: Right now, this is set up to do one file at a time. This will completely overwrite the
				original file with the beautified code.
		
		Example:
			> ant beautify -Dbfile=project/javascript/file.js
		
		Results:
			The results of this WILL OVERWRITE THE FILE THAT YOU SPECIFY with the beautified code. That's why
			it's only set up to do one file at a time.
